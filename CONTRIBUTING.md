## General

### Coding Style

We use prettier with the given config file. Just run it before checking in or configure your IDE to run it on save.

### Naming Conventions

- Variables, keys, etc.: camelCase
- Classes, Interfaces, Types, etc.: PascalCase
- Folders: dash-case
- Files
  - Containing Types, Interfaces, etc.: PascalCase
  - Other: camelCase
  - Tests have the extension `.test.ts`

### Git Workflow

New features should be developed in extra branches named `feat*`. These branches will be deployed on the testing page.

Bigger refactorings should be discussed first.

Please write meaningful commit messages. Commit messages can also have more than just a short title if needed.

## Writing generators

Question generators are located in `shared/src/question-generators`.
Each generator should have its own folder containing the generator as well as unit tests. You can find an example in `example/example`

To access a new generator though the website you need to set a path to the generator in `settings/questionSelections.ts`. If the chosen path has no common prefix path with the other generators, you can add human-readable names for the new generator group in `settings/generator-locales` and an image in `settings/questionSelections.ts`

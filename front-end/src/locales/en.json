  "About.development.text": "This site is under heavy development, utterly incomplete, and things might break without notice! Our plan for this site is to provide exam-level questions for as many intended learning outcomes of the algorithms and data structures courses.

For this reason, [spaced repetition]({{0}}) is an absolutely essential learning technique! On this site, you will be asked to solve the same type of problem multiple times, but with increasing intervals between the repetitions. This way, you will be able to remember the skill for a much longer time.",

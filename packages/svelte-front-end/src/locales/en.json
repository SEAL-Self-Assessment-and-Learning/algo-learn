  "About.activeLearning.text": "This site is supposed to complement lectures, videos, and textbooks by providing you with a set of interactive exercises that will help you to practice the skills that you have seen in class. You get instant feedback and can try as often as you like.",
  "About.authors.label": "Authors",
  "About.authors.text": "Created by [Holger Dell](https://holgerdell.com) and [Alex Schickedanz](https://ae.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/staff/alex_schickedanz.html) as well as [other developers](https://github.com/SEAL-Self-Assessment-and-Learning/algo-learn/people).",
  "About.development.label": "Development",
  "About.development.text": "This site is under heavy development, utterly incomplete, and things might break without notice! Our plan for this site is to provide exam-level questions for as many intended learning outcomes of the algorithms and data structures courses. This should be possible for all learning outcomes at levels “remember/understand/apply” according to [Bloom's taxonomy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/).",
  "About.individuallyAdaptive.label": "Individually adaptive",
  "About.individuallyAdaptive.text": "To implement spaced repetition, we use [half-life regression](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/p16-1174) as the model for how your memory works. We employ a simple artificial intelligence algorithm to identify which problems you tend to struggle with, and present them to you more often. Over time, the algorithm adapts to your demonstrated skill strength.",

  "About.spacedRepetition.label": "Spaced repetition",
  "About.spacedRepetition.text": "Our brains forget things rather quickly if we do not repeatedly try to remember them. For this reason, [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is an absolutely essential learning technique! On this site, you will be asked to solve the same type of problem multiple times, but with increasing intervals between the repetitions. This way, you will be able to remember the skill for a much longer time.",
